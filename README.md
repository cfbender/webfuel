# Webfuel

The free and open-source online holistic web development learning platform.


## Development

Clone this repo and run `yarn dev` to run the local development environment

## Usage

This site is divided into two main categories, Challenges and Learn. The challenges section is for coding challenges where a function will be run against a test suite, and the learn section is for blog-style educational content.

## Growing the site

If you would like to submit some content, feel free to fork this repo and submit a new challenge or blog post in the same style as what is in `challenges.json` or `learn.json`. I'd love to add more content from outside authors!
